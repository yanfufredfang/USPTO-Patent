# USPTO-Patent
For update USPTO patent regular
USPTO has a long traditional to publish patents grant data on it website: https://developer.uspto.gov/product/patent-grant-full-text-dataxml
However, the data was stored in the unhandy XML format. For scholars who would like to draw on patents for research, the XML format is unconvenient to deal with. In addition, USPTO publish grant data weekly, making the number of files large.
